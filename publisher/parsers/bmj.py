Currently, there are no treatment guidelines or safety and efficacy studies on the management of cerebral vasculitis in this context. Herein, we report a case of a previously well 11-year-old girl who presented with acute otitis media that progressed to mastoiditis and fulminant meningitis. Group A <i>Streptococcus</i> was found in blood and ear-fluid cultures (lumbar puncture was unsuccessful). Her decreased level of consciousness persisted despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment, and repeat MRI revealed extensive large vessel cerebral vasculitis. Based on expert opinion and a presumed inflammatory mechanism, her cerebral vasculitis was treated with 7\u2009days of pulse intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone taper. She was also treated with intravenous heparin. Following these therapies, she improved clinically and radiographically with no adverse events. She continues to undergo rehabilitation with improvement.</p>",

Research in this area conducted with a focus on ethnic minority older adults is also needed, as their help-seeking behaviours may be influenced by various cultural factors. This scoping review aims to explore the global literature on the factors associated with help-seeking behaviours of older adults and how cultural values and backgrounds may impact ethnic minority older adults\u2019 help-seeking behaviours in different ways.</p><h3>Methods and analysis</h3>\n<p>The scoping review process will be guided by the methodology framework of Arksey and O\u2019Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. The following electronic databases will be systematically searched from January 2005 onwards: MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Scopus. Studies of various designs and methodologies consisting of older adults aged 65 years or older, who are exhibiting help-seeking behaviours for the purpose of remedying a physical or mental health challenge, will be considered for inclusion. Two reviewers will screen full texts and chart data. The results of this scoping review will be summarised quantitatively through numerical counts and qualitatively through a narrative synthesis.</p><h3>Ethics and dissemination</h3>\n<p>As this is a scoping review of published literature, ethics approval is not required. Results will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal.</p><h3>Discussion</h3>\n<p>This scoping review will synthesise the current literature related to the help-seeking behaviours of older adults and ethnic minority older adults. It will identify current gaps in research and potential ways to move forward in developing or implementing strategies that support the various health needs of the diverse older adult population.</p><h3>Registration</h3>\n<p>This scoping review protocol has been registered with the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/69kmx).</p>",

On admission, CT chest demonstrated multiple cavitary lesions as well as numerous small infarcts seen on MRI brain concerning for systemic septic emboli. Subsequent transthoracic echo with bubble study revealed a large patent foramen ovale (PFO). The patient later received surgical debulking of his tricuspid valve vegetation with AngioVac. Subsequently, PFO closure was performed with a NobleStitch device.
